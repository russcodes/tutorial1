      <p>Russell Robertson <i>(pictured above)</i> is a second year software 
      engineering student at Western University. He has very little to offer in
      terms of technical ability or experience, but is very happy with how this 
      first attempt using HTML is working out!</p>
      <h2 id="about me">About Me</h2>
      <p>I am born and raised in Ajax Ontario and due to the passage of time, 
        have found myself in software engineering at Western University! I have
        since thoroughly enjoyed coding and am really excited to continue to 
        develop my skills. To introduce myself, I will simply list my interests
        because I think the breadth of them show that I'm a very active and 
        busy minded person. Throughout High School, I was in band, played badminton,
        tennis, volleyball, and soccer. Soccer was always my main sport and I 
        played on the Western varsity team last year. I got cut now but guys it's 
        okay because <br><br><br><br>
        In my free time, I really enjoy spending time with my friends. My 
        friends mean the absolute world to me and make life worth living and I 
        really cherish them. I also love music, fashion, soccer still, food,
        animals, and sleeping.

      <h2 id="work experience">Work Experience</h2>
      <p>As much as I would be interested in incorperating other functions, this 
        section is a little underfed. With not much work experience, I am full
        of untapped potential because I'm very interested but have not yet
        been self motivated enough to thoroughly dive into this interest.<br/>
        The work experience I do have is bounded to 17$ an hour or less so far 
        sadly. I worked at my local walmart as a grocery shopper for 2 years, 
        and over this recent summer I worked for my friend and role model's 
        window cleaning business. I'm currently saving up money doing window 
        cleaning out of a uhaul on my own time in order to take over his business
        this summer by buying the cars and his customer list.<br/> 
        This about concludes my work experience and project section, but if you
        see this website in a few years time, reader, I hope to not let you down
